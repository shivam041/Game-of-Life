# Game-of-Life

The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. It is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. I recreated this populare game using java and implemented a GUI to animate the output of the code.
